### 4.2_Spring_Framework_Basics_Level1
## CRUD exercise with H2

Access the page ->https://start.spring.io/, and generate a Spring boot project with the following characteristics:

#### PROJECT (dependency manager)

* Maven or Gradle

#### LANGUAGE

* Java

#### SPRING BOOT

* Latest stable version

#### PROJECT METADATA

* Group: cat.itacademy.s04.t02.n01

* Artifact: S04T02N01

* Name: S04T02N01

* Description: S04T02N01GognomsNom

* Package name: cat.itacademy.s04.t02.n01

#### PACKAGING

* Jar

#### JAVA

* Minimum version 11

#### Dependencies

* Spring Boot DevTools

* Spring Web

* Spring Data JPA

* H2 Database

We have an entity called "Fruit", which has the following properties:

* int id
* String name
* int weightInKilograms

Using the JPA specification, we will have to persist this entity to an H2 database, following the MVC pattern. For this, depending on the main Package, we will create a package structure, where we will place the classes we need:

 * cat.itacademy.s04.t02.n01.controllers
 * cat.itacademy.s04.t02.n01.model
 * cat.itacademy.s04.t02.n01.services
 * cat.itacademy.s04.t02.n01.repository
 *cat.itacademy.s04.t02.n01.exception

The class located in the controllers package (FruitaController, for example), must be able to respond to the following requests to update and consult information:

* http://localhost:8080/fruit/add
* http://localhost:8080/fruit/update
* http://localhost:8080/fruit/delete/{id}
* http://localhost:8080/fruit/getOne/{id}
* http://localhost:8080/fruit/getAll
